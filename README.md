# Project Specs
Each project spec must comprise the following elements:
0. rationale ($, why, customer, market)
1. the set of features in it (what it is and what it does, what it is not)
2. design (UX flow, mockups, wireframes)
3. dependencies to other features / projects
4. constraints (infrastructure, physics)
5. architecture for the core features
6. milestones and timeline

Note: it should not exceed 5 pages
Note: if features become too detailed, then they should have their own sub-specs with the same format
